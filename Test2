What are three things you can do in order to speed up a website's load time? (20pts)

1. minify, compress and cache your html, css and javascript
	2. minimize the use of render blocking resources by using media queries on <link> to unblock rendering and inline css
	3. minimize the use of parser blocking resources by defering javascript executior OR use an async attribute on the script
	utilizing these methods will ultimately help accomplish three things that will speed load time: minimizing the amount of
data(bytes) to send, reducing the number of critical resources, and shorten hte critical rending path(CRP) length

2. Go to the Google PageSpeed insights page and analyze ncl.com Choose three of the shortcomings this website has and explain the
specific tools and workflows we discussed in class which could help this website address these shortcomings.

Firstly, Following js is causing render blocking. https://cdn-a2-ncl.optimizely.com/js/5414371492.js  In other words, this js file
is keeping the rest of the html from rendering because JavaScript needs to be fetched first. Since html reads top to bottomn, I recommend
moving all js files to the bottom of the html page so the rest can render before- this will reduce the number of round trips the browser
must make which will reduce load time. Another thing you can do is use the async script attribute but only if the js file does not need
to access the DOM or CSS in order to render. The async attribute tells the browser that it does not have to block DOM construction when
it encounters the script tag and it also does not block CSSOM.Secondly, there are 4 images that are very large in file size, causing the
speed to load slower. Compress each image by simply reducing the file size. you can use PageSpeed's Enable Compression Tool or if you want,
you can use your own apps such as Paint.net, Picture Tools or Photoshop. You can also crop the image to reduce the file size. Thirdly, there
are two redirects from the given url to the final landing page. It has to go from http://ncl.com/ to http://www.ncl.com/ in order to get to the
secure url https://www.ncl.com/. Redirects trigger an additional HTTP request-response cycle and delay page rendering. since the urls of ncl.com
are similar, include the https://www.ncl.com/ in your html and it will render without any redirects.

3.What is the render tree?(20pts)

It's the structure that captures the content and properties of the html and all relationships between the nodes once all tokens are consumed. This is
not to be confused with the DOM tree. While the DOM tree is essentially the tree containing all of your HTML elements/nodes, the render tree is a
culmination of the DOM and CSSOM trees and is what visibly shows up on your page.

4. Explain the process of a how a website loads in terms of the internal data structures built and used by the browser (DOM, CSSOM, etc).(20pts)
First you have the start and end tags <> with certain characters in side- these characters get converted into tokens, be it html, head, body etc.
The browser emits a token when it reads these characters. Another process consumes the tokens and converts them into nodes. The conversion of 
character(or html response)-token-nodes creates the DOM or Document Object Model. This DOM captures the content and properties of html and all
the relationships between the nodes. the nodes contain all relevant information about the html element. The nodes are connected to the DOM tree
based on a token hierarchy-html is read from top to bottom. Then a similar process takes place in creating the CSSOM or the CSS Object Model.
It also takes in CSS characters and the parser converts tokens into nodes. Examples are body and paragraph elements. CSS is render blocking in
that it will block all other rendering until it receives all CSS information. This is why it is important to either defer or async JavaScript,
compress images and be careful of where and how other elements of your page are placed in the html hierarchy. the less render blocking your page has,
the less round trips the browser has to take in order to fetch those elements and therefore, the faster your page will load.
